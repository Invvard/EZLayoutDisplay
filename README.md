## Presentation
_EZ Layout Display_ is a Windows application for ErgoDox EZ enthusiasts and new comers, that displays your configured layout right from your desktop.

## Installation
You can find the archive with all the necessary files in the [release section](https://github.com/Invvard/EZLayoutDisplay/releases).

Just unzip the archive to the desired location.

When it's done, start the app and you'll see the icon below appear in the notification center :

Right click on this icon will give you access to the settings window, about dialog and, of course, the layout window.

The default ErgoDox Layout is configured but you can change it very easily : just copy-paste your ErgoDox Configurator custom layout URL in the settings window and you'll be good to go.

## How it works
By pressing **Hyper + Space** (or one left click on the tray icon), you'll instantly see a window with your configured layout.

You can browse the different layers by hitting the **Space** bar.

It is designed to be a quick reminder of your layout, so as soon as it loses focus or if you hit the **Escape** key, the layout window will disappear.

## Roadmap 
Right now, settings and customisation are a bit scarce but I've a lot of [ToDos and ideas](https://github.com/Invvard/EZLayoutDisplay/projects/1) to implement.
