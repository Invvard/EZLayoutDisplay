# EZ Layout Display

### IT'S A BETA !
I developed this app in my spare time and I've only tested it with my setup (Windows 10 Pro x64 + Ergodox EZ Glow), so there will be bugs. Nothing catastrophic though : it's a .NET app so there's very little room to harm anything ;)
And there's no interaction whatsoever with your peripheral devices, even with the Ergodox.

## Presentation
_EZ Layout Display_ is a Windows application for Ergodox EZ enthusiasts and new comers, that displays your configured layout right from your desktop.

## How it works
By pressing **Hyper + Space**, you'll instantly see a window with your configured layout (work best if it matches your actual keyboard layout ;))

## Installation
You can get the installer in the release tab and install it on your Windows.

When it's done, just start the app and you'll see an icon appear in the notification center.
The default Ergodox Layout is configured but you can change it very easily : just copy-paste your Ergodox Configurator in the settings window and you'll be good to go.

## Roadmap 
Right now, settings and customisation are a bit scarce but I've a lot of ToDos and ideas to implement.
Of course, your input(s) (ideas, contributions, thanks or even brand new Ergodox) are very much welcome !
