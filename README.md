# EZ Layout Display

## Archived project
**This project has been retired and won't get any more update**

The last release will remain the [1.3.0-beta](https://github.com/Invvard/EZLayoutDisplay/releases/tag/1.3.0-beta) as unit tests were never updated.

After 3 years of development, 2 years of support and the public release of a similar app called [Keymapp](https://www.zsa.io/flash) by ZSA, it's time for me to put an end to this project.
I have enjoyed developing it, learned a lot and discovered what it's like to maintain and support an open-source project.
Thank you all for your support, suggestions and help throughout the years. I'm sure Keymapp will help all the new comers to ZSA keyboards as well to the seasoned users.

Before shutting down for good, I'd like to thank [@vladzaharia](https://github.com/vladzaharia) for his contribution supporting the Moonlander Mk1 in the app.

EZLayoutDisplay is dead, long live Keymapp!

## Presentation
_EZ Layout Display_ is a Windows application for ErgoDox EZ enthusiasts and new comers, that displays your configured layout right from your desktop.

## Installation
You can find the archive with all the necessary files in the [release section](https://github.com/Invvard/EZLayoutDisplay/releases).

Just unzip the archive to the desired location.

When it's done, start the app and you'll see the icon below appear in the system tray :

![EZ Layout Display logo](https://github.com/Invvard/EZLayoutDisplay/blob/master/resources/Images/EZLayoutDisplay_TrayIcon_Small.png)

Right click on this icon will give you access to the settings window, about dialog and, of course, the layout window.

The default ErgoDox Layout is configured but you can change it very easily : just copy-paste your ErgoDox Configurator custom layout URL in the settings window and you'll be good to go.

## How it works
By pressing **Hyper + Space** (or one left click on the tray icon), you'll instantly see a window with your configured layout.

You can browse the different layers by hitting the **Space** bar.

It is designed to be a quick reminder of your layout, so as soon as it loses focus or if you hit the **Escape** key, the layout window will disappear.
